I've lost the plot again
Tell your friends to sharpen their teeth
There's a few quid to be made
And my soul's a sorry state
So come on down, you empty lovers
Worms come out of the woodwork
And the snakes start to sing
Do you feel the chill
Clawing at the back of your neck?
I start to spill
Did you really think that you could fix me?
They'll sell your bones for another roll
Well, sharpen your teeth
Tell yourself that it's just business
Worms come out of the woodwork
Leeches come from out of the dirt
Rats come out of the holes they call home
And I fall apart
And the snakes start to sing
Don't say I'm better off dead
'Cause heaven's full and hell won't have me
Won't you make some room in your bed
Well, you could lock me up in your heart
And throw away the key
Won't you take me out of my head?
